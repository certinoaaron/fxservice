- transparency to end user, we need to explain rate that was used on value, consider do we send back original value.
- If no free source of fx rates via API or solution then a user (TS or CS) will need to update and add additional values to DB
- CRUD Interface to review values, allows users to view existing rates and update (prior point)
- example calls?: 
- average/GBP/USD/2020-01-31
- eom/GBP/USD/2020-01-31
